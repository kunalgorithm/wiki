Hyper is my command line of choice. I used [iTerm](https://iterm2.com/) previously and found it more powerful, but eventually switched to Hyper because

1. The aesthetic. I mean, c'mon üòç. 
2. it's open source and built with Javascript.  
3. I'm an enormous fan of the [ZEIT](https://zeit.co/) team. 



### [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Editor of choice for JavaScript, TypeScript, and most web development technologies aside from Python. 

The exensions I have installed and use regularly are: 

- [Sublime Text Keymap and Settings Importer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.sublime-keybindings) - facillitates transitioning to VSCode from Sublime Text because it lets you bring all your favorite keymappings with you. 
- [saveBackup](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=purplestone.savebackup) - handy utility to back up files of code. 
- [Gitlens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) - supercharged git 
- [Path Intellisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=christian-kohler.path-intellisense) - extremely handy tool for linking to relative paths 
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) - opinionated automatic formatting tool. Invalueble for Javascript development. 
- [Debugger for Chrome](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome)

### [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) 

IDE of choice for python development.

### [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) 

 All general-purpose editing. My editor of choice for Javascript before recently switching to VSCode. I find the `subl` command line command invalueble for opening and quickly editting text files.
