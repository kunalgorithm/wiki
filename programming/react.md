# React

The best place to get started with React is to read the [Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs), then tinker with the examples.

The smallest React example is as follows

```text
ReactDom.render(
    <h3>Hi, there!</h3>,
    document.getElementById('root')
)
```

A minimal functional component

```text
export default () => {
    return (
        <div>Hi there</div>
    );
}
```
