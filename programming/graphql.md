# GraphQL 

GraphQL is an API specification by Facebook that is kind of like REST, but better. It allows you to transfer data through a single endpoint by using structured queries to request and deliver data with precision. This liberates backend developers to focus on business logic and frontend developers to manage and display data - *instead of everyone scrambling to configure and predict the transfer of data through a legion of endpoints*. (I'm looking at you, REST).

The [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) website describes it best.

## Resources

- [VulcanJS](http://vulcanjs.org/) - perhaps the most promising and comprehensive full-stack Javascript framework that ties together all of the hottest JS technologies: GraphQL, React, Meteor, and more. VulcanJS seems to be the fastest way and most seamless way to build an by focusing almost entirely on what makes it unique and abstracting away almost everything else. The instagram clone example app is the perfect demonstration, and their Youtube Channel is invalueble in getting started. Also, VulcanJS is written by [Sacha Greif](http://sachagreif.com/), an author of [Discover Meteor](http://discovermeteor.com/) and founder of [State of JavaScript](http://stateofjs.com/).
