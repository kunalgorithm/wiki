## Habits

I'm a huge believer in setting microgoals to build and maintain productive and rewarding habits. This is predicated in the belief that building a new habit, however small, is numerous times more difficult--and thus rewarding--than extending an existing habit.

Basically, it's harder to to go from running 0 minutes a day to running 5 minutes a day than it is to go from running 5 minutes a day to running 60 minutes a day. Which is why running 5 minutes a day is an enormous leap forward.

Then, this pohilosophy can be extended from running to other exercise, sleeping habits, eating healthy, reading, learning new languages, learning to code, ad inititum.

### Exercise

My primary goal in exercising is using it as a vehicle to feel good. My workouts are specifically designed to maximize my mood, energy, and focus throughtout the day, primarily by stimulating the production of mitochondria in the body and brain and miximizing the utility of sleep. The improvement of my physique and other benefits of exercise are secondary goals.
