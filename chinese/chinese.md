# Chinese

Chinese is a pictographic language&mdash;it's built on pictures. Chinese characters are drawn left to right and top to bottom, and are built upon other characters in the language, like dominos.

Pinyin is the pronunciation of each character in Chinese. Pinyin includes different tones and short sylables.
