# Vocabulary

This file is a mind-dump of notes, references, characters, and definitions that I built as a I began to learn Chinese. Consequently, it's a disorganized shitshow of a document and won't be too useful in learning or reviewing. Creating your own, however, would be a different story.

Let's start slow. With numbers, naturally.

一 二 三 = yi er san = one two three.

三 Q, pronounced "san Q", has become the internet/slang way of saying thank you.

| pinyin | character | meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| yī | 一 | one |
| èr | 二 | two |
| sān | 三 | three |
| sanQ | 三 Q | Thank You \(slang\) |
| xié xei | 谢谢 | Thank You |
| kōu | 口 | mouth，opening |
| wèi |  | smell |
| yi kou | 一口 | one mouthful |
| chi | 吃 | eat |

Chinese is beautiful.

一日， 二日， 三日，一口，二口， 三口

| pinyin | character | meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| rì | 日 | Day, Sun |
| bái | 白 | White |
| bái bái | 白白 | goodbye |
| bái rì | 白日 | Day time - "bright day" |
| yi bai | 一白 | one hundred |

**Characters = sound + idea**

The idea won't give you the entire meaning of a word, but it can come close.

## Context & Tones

How do we differentiate between characters in speech? ie. 白 versus 百 ?? bai vs bai

There are 4 tones.

1. Flat tone
2. Rising tone. In English, we use the rising tone when asking a question. how?
3. Roller coaster - goes down then up.
4. Down tone?

## People and Countries

哈哈 - haha

人人 - people

人口 - entrance or exit, because it's a person going into a place.

中 - zhōng - center, middle, stick

王 - wáng - King. 国王 is a literal country's king. **The character at the end is the most important**, so 国王 is the king of a country, whereas if you flip it 王国 is now a King-Country, or a **Kingdom**.

玉 - yù - Jade, Precious

国 - guó - Country. composed of a gem + King

美 mêi - Beautiful

You place one character in front of 国 and you have a country. So, when you put 美 in front of 国 you have 美国, which is the US, mei-guo.

What about yīng guó, 英国 that is the UK, yīng guô.

Then we have the central country, or the middle country, which is zhōng guô, or 中国. This is **China**.

中国人 - is a Chinese person.

Obama 是美国人 - Obama is an American person.

## Verbs

是 shì - to be. This is our first chinese **verb**. We must remember that Chinese characters, unlike those of other languages, cannot be conjugated. So, shi not only means to be, but was is, was, am, etc.

| Character | Pinyin |
| :--- | :--- |
| 我 | wô |
| 要 | yào |
| 是 | shì |
| 哦 | ó |
| 不谢 | bú xiè |
| 帮不帮 | bāng bú bāng |
| 饿 | è |
| 巧克力 | qiâo kè lì |
| 咖啡 | kā fēi |

## Tone Changes

An exception **tone** **change** happens when two 4 tones happen together, like 不是. Now instead of bù shì, we change the bu to the **second** tone so the phrase sounds nicer, bú shì.

Similarly, when followed by a fourth tone, a first tone changes to a second tone, but this is far less common.

| Character | pinyin |
| :--- | :--- |
| 大 | dà |
| 小 | Xiǎo |
| 大小 | dà xiǎo \(size\) |
| 刀 | dāo |
| 你是不是中国人 | nǐ shì bù shì zhōng guó rén |
| 多少钱 | duō shǎo qián \(how much money?\) |
| 块 | kuài |
| 女 | nü |
| 土 | tǔ |

## 也 · yě · Also

* 也 yě
* 我要！ 我也要！

  **Rule**： 也 comes after the pronoun!

* 她 - tā - she/her: woman, also.
* 他 - tā - he/she: man, also.
* 他也是中国人 - he is also Chinese
* 她也要巧克力 - she also wants chocolate
* 它 - tā - it. However, "it" is not used too much.

## All Pronouns

![assets/pronouns.png](https://github.com/kunalgorithm/wiki/tree/7d22d2f3d4e50b356190050fcf1f434a51eeab09/chinese/assets/pronouns.png)

## Measure Words

General measure word. It tells what category the noun is in. It adds some context by providing a relevant context before a word that might otherwise be confused.

| :--- | :--- |
| 我们 | wǒ mén |
| 你们 | you guys |
| 他们 | they |
| 都 | dōu - all |
| 两个都 | both |
| 儿 | ér |

* pay attention when and where you use 都 with an object
* **Rule**: 都 cannot finish a sentence. It will precede the verb.

一个， 两个， 三个，四个，四拜个，

死 - prounced the same, but means death.

子 is often placed at the end of words, and will turn them into nouns. 儿子 is son. 王子 is a prince. 小子 is a naughty kid. 日子 is a day.

### Vocabulary

门口，们，我们，你们，他们，你们是不是中国人？，她们，都，我们都，美国人都要我，两个都，我两个都要，四百块， 死

From the north: 门儿， 人儿

月 - yuè - moon/month

胖 - pàng - fat

半 - bàn - half

月 is used very often to represent a body part. 要 is your hip and 腿 is your leg. 胖！ means that you're fat, but to say fatso we say 胖子。

你是一个胖子 you are a fatso.

孩子 haizi = Child, children

NOTE: Chinese does distinguish the singular from the plural noun.

一个孩子 = a child

两个孩子 = two children. we still use 孩子

## Hǎo

好 - means good and is a combination of a child 子 and a woman 女。 This is how we can remember that 好 means good.

好不好 = OK？

NG 🆖 = No Good!

很 = hěn = very

step + tough = very

我很好 = I am good

很 = hěn is used all the time in Chinese when using an adjective to describe a noun, so it doesn't mean _very_ as much as the equivalent in Engilsh.

很多人 = a lot of people! 👩‍👩‍👧‍👦👩‍👩‍👦‍👦👨‍👨‍👧‍👦

我恨你 = I hate you. Here, hèn means hate, not very. 恨 = heart + tough ❤️⚒

我很恨你 = I hate you very much. **wo hěn hèn ni** which is "**I very hate you.**"

### Answering questions in Chinese

When answering something in Chinese, all you need to remember is what the question is. You take the core from the question and mirror it back to the asked. So you can respond to 可以吗 with 可以 or 不可以！

For example

* What will it be? This or that? 
* This and that!  都可以！ All OK！
