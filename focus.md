# Focus 

Focus is the engine of all learning, progress, and accomplishment. It is therefore worthwhile to invest in strategies to optimize your ability to focus.  



## Rules 

I follow a number of strict rules to fall into and maintain focus on my work. My goal is to turn maintainable focus into an engrained habit so that it can be a more enjoyable and less effortful act. Here's what I follow: 

- Keep all social media, messaging, and generally time-wasting apps out of sight. On my phone, this means on the second page of a folder on the second page of my screen, so that I have to purposefully search for them instead of stumbling upon them and unintentionally having my attention sucked. I am especially wary of apps that have the *endless scrolling* feature, which makes mindless rapid consumption (the opposite of focus) into a habit. 
- I try to keep my computer free of non-productive or unrewarding apps.
