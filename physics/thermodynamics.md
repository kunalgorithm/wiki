## Laws of Thermodynamics 

### First Law

The first law is a statement of conservation of energy laws:

$$
\Delta U = Q - W
$$

The first law can be expressed as the change in internal energy of a system \($$\Delta U$$\)  equals the amount of energy added to a system \( $$Q$$ \), such as heat, minus the work expended by the system on its surroundings \(W\).

If Q is positive, the system has gained energy \(by heating\).

If W is positive, the system has lost energy from doing work on its surroundings. 

### Zero-th Law

After the first law of Thermodynamics, physicists \(conveniently ğŸ™„\) realized that there was a another more fundamental law, which they termed the "zero-th", which is:

> If two bodies are at the same temperature, there is no resultant heat flow between them

Or alternatively,

> If two bodies are in thermal equilibrium with a third, they are in thermal equilibrium with each other.

This second statement allows us to define Temperature \(T\)

> Temperature is the only thing that is the same between two otherwise unlike bodies that are in thermal equilibrium with each other.

### Second Law

> Heat will never of itself flow from a cold object to a hot object

$$
S = k_b \times ln(\Omega)
$$

where $$k_b$$ is the Boltzmann constant and $$\Omega$$ is the partition function. That is the statistical definition of entropy, there is also a macroscopic definition:

$$
S = \int \frac {dQ} T
$$

where T is the temperature and dQ is the increment in energy of the system. 

### Third Law

> The temperature of absolute zero cannot be reached.

Yep, that's it. 



### Specific Latent Heat 

Energy is needed to break bonds when a substance changes state. This energy is _latent heat._ The important part is that temperature **remains constant** during changes of state.

To calculate the energy needed for a change of state, the following equation is used: 

$$
Heat\ transferred, \Delta Q(J)=Mass, m(kg) \times specific\ latent\ heat\ capacity, L\ (J/kg)
$$

The specific latent heat, L, is the energy needed to change the state of 1 kg of the substance without changing the temperature. 

* The latent heat of fusion refers to melting. 
* The latent heat of vaporization refers to boiling. 

### Specific Heat Capacity

> The energy needed to raise the temperature of a given mass by a certain temperature.

$$
\Delta U= m \times c \times \Delta T
$$

Where:

* U is the internal energy, in Joules
* m is the mass, in kg
* c is the specific heat capacity, in J/\(kg \* K\)
* and T is the temperature change, in K
