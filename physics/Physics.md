# Physics

The aim of physics is to understand the natural world, in its broadest and most fundamental sense. By understanding it, we can therefore explain, predict and ultimately control events. Physics deals with everything that happens in this Universe, tries to understand it and provides the root cause for the same in a logical manner.
