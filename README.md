# About this wiki

This wiki is thorough documentation of what I know, what I'm learning, and what I intend to learn. It's primarily for my personal use as a universal notebook, but I've tried to make it as reader-friendly as possible and made it publically available in case it may be useful to anyone else.

You can find the source code repository for this wiki [here](https://github.com/kunalgorithm/wiki). For more information about the physical structure of this project and my procedures for maintaining it, visit the [meta](meta.md) section.  

## Rules 

I've instilled and followed a number of rules during the creation and maintanance of this wiki:

- **Be objective**. Make the informational sections of this wiki as object and unopinionated as possible, and qualify my preferences whenever they appear. Some parts of this wiki, such my mentors and routines, are inextricably personal in nature. 
- **Be original.**: do not repeat myself or anyone else. If a concept is described elsewhere, either within this wiki or anywhere else, link to it rather than reiterate its contents. Exceptions to this rule include briefly summarizing a concept or reframing it to fit a different context. 
- **Be concise.** Do not use a big word where a small word will do. The same goes for sentences, descriptions, annecdotes, analogies, instruction sets, code snippets, or anything else you may be inclined to ramble on about.
