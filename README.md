# Wiki

This wiki is thorough documentation of what I know, what I'm learning, and what I intend to learn. It's primarily for my personal use as a universal notebook, but I've tried to make it as reader-friendly as possible and made it publically available in case it may be useful to anyone else.

This wiki was primarily inspired by Nikita's wiki.
