# Applications

I like to think of tools as extensions of myself, and enjoy experimenting with various ones to find those that fit me best and contribute most to my efficacy. 

Mac Apps 

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - my IDE of choice for Javascript programming.

[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) - a less robust IDE for scripting and environment-independent programming tasks 

[Typora](https://typora.io) - Markdown editor I use to write my [wiki](wiki.Kunal.space) and edit more robust README documents. 

[FastPass](https://lastpass.com/) - Randomly generate and store secure passwords to prevent hacks and relieve myself of having to keep passwords in memory, besides a master password.
