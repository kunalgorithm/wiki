# Applications

I like to think of tools as extensions of myself, and enjoy experimenting with various ones to find those that fit me best and contribute most to my efficacy. 

Mac Apps 

VSCode - my IDE of choice for Javascript programming.

Sublime Text - a less robust IDE for scripting and environment-independent programming tasks 

Typora - Markdown editor I use to write my [wiki](wiki.Kunal.space) and edit more robust README documents.
