# Chinese 

Chinese is a pictographic language&mdash;it's built on pictures. Chinese characters are drawn left to right and top to bottom, and are built upon other characters in the language, like dominos. 

Pinyin is the pronunciation of each character in Chinese. Pinyin includes different tones and short sylables. 

一 二 三  means  *yi er san*

三Q  is the internet was of saying thank you. 

| pinyin  | character | meaning           |
| ------- | --------- | ----------------- |
| yī      | 一        | one               |
| èr      | 二        | two               |
| sān     | 三        | three             |
| sanQ    | 三Q       | Thank You (slang) |
| xié xei | 谢谢      | Thank You         |
| kōu     | 口        | mouth，opening    |
| wèi     |           | smell             |
| yi kou  | 一口      | one mouthful      |
| chi     | 吃        | eat               |

Chinese is beautiful. 

一日， 二日， 三日，一口，二口， 三口

| pinyin  | character | meaning                 |
| ------- | --------- | ----------------------- |
| rì      | 日        | Day, Sun                |
| bái     | 白        | White                   |
| bái bái | 白白      | goodbye                 |
| bái rì  | 白日      | Day time - "bright day" |
| yi bai  | 一白      | one hundred             |



**Characters = sound  + idea**

The idea won't give you the entire meaning of a word, but it can come close. 

## Context & Tones

How do we differentiate between characters in speech? 

ie. 白 versus 百 ?? bai vs bai 

Context and **Tones** 

There are 4 tones. 

1. Flat tone 

2. Rising tone. In English, we use the rising tone when asking a question.  how?

3. Roller coaster - goes down then up. 

4. Down tone?

## People and Countries

哈哈  - haha 

人人 - people

人口 - entrance or exit, because it's a person going into a place. 

中 - zhōng - center, middle, stick

王 - wáng - King. 国王 is a literal country's king. **The character at the end is the most important**, so 国王is the king of a country, whereas if you flip it 王国 is now a King-Country, or a **Kingdom**. 

 玉 - yù - Jade, Precious 

国 - guó - Country. composed of a gem + King 

美 mêi - Beautiful 

You place one character in front of 国 and you have a country. So, when you put 美 in front of 国 you have 美国, which is the US, mei-guo. 

What about yīng guó, 英国 that is the UK, yīng guô. 

Then we have the central country, or the middle country, which is zhōng guô, or 中国. This is **China**. 

中国人 - is a Chinese person.

Obama是美国人 - Obama is an American person. 



## Verbs 

是 shì - to be. This is our first chinese **verb**.  We must remember that Chinese characters, unlike those of other languages, cannot be conjugated. So, shi not only means to be, but was is, was, am, etc. 

| Character | Pinyin       |
| --------- | ------------ |
| 我        | wô           |
| 要        | yào          |
| 是        | shì          |
| 哦        | ó            |
| 不谢      | bú xiè       |
| 帮不帮    | bāng bú bāng |
| 饿        | è            |
| 巧克力    | qiâo kè lì   |
| 咖啡      | kā fēi       |

## Tone Changes 

An exception **tone** **change** happens when two 4 tones happen together, like 不是. Now instead of bù shì, we change the bu to the **second** tone so the phrase sounds nicer, bú shì. 

Similarly, when followed by a fourth tone, a first tone changes to a second tone, but this is far less common. 

| Character      | pinyin                           |

| 大             | dà                               |

NOTE: Chinese does distinguish the singular from the plural noun. 

一个孩子 = a child

两个孩子 = two children. we still use 孩子



## Hǎo

好 - means good and is a combination of a child 子 and a woman 女。 This is how we can remember that 好 means good. 

好不好 = OK？ 

NG 🆖 = No Good! 

很 = hěn = very

step + tough = very

我很好 = I am good

很 = hěn is used all the time in Chinese when using an adjective to describe a noun, so it doesn't mean *very* as much as the equivalent in Engilsh. 

很多人 = a lot of people!  👩‍👩‍👧‍👦👩‍👩‍👦‍👦👨‍👨‍👧‍👦

我恨你 =  I hate you. Here, hèn means hate, not very. 恨 = heart + tough ❤️⚒

我很恨你 = I hate you very much. **wo hěn hèn ni** which is "**I very hate you.**"
